-- Matrix Multiply Workbook
--
-- Use the Coordinate List representation of a sparse matrix
-- as a table of tuples for the populated matrix values.
--    Matrix A (rownum, colnum, value)
--    Matrix B (rownum, colnum, value)
--
-- Product P(i,j) = âˆ‘ A(i,k) * B(k,j), over all k
-- Note: A x B is only defined when k matches for the matrices
--
-- The matrix product becomes a JOIN and a GROUP BY SUM.
-- JOIN ON A.colnum = B.rownum
--    ensures A.value, B.value has matching k
-- SUM (A.value * B.value) GROUP BY (A.rownum, B.colnum)
--    ensures summation over all k
--
-- Results:
-- Matrix A (10K, 2K) = 20M cells, sparse 17M, 
-- Matrix B (2K, 5K) = 10M cells, sparse 9M, 4.5GB
-- Product (50M cells): 8m on S, 3m52s on M, 1m52 on L, 58s on XL
--
-- Matrix A (1K, 2K) = 2M cells, sparse 1.7M, 850MB
-- Matrix B (2K, 700)= 1.4M cells, sparse 1.3M, 626MB
-- Product (700K cells) = 4s on L
-- 4x =  9s on L
-- 16x = 22s on L x 2 clusters
-- 32x = 40s on L x 2 clusters
-- 128x = 130s on L x 2 clusters
